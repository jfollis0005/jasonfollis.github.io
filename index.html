            Hello! My name is Jason Follis, and I was born and raised in Nashville, TN. I am currently 32, and I am married with a beautiful little boy.<br><br>
            I have lived through all walks of life, most due to poor choices as a child. I am a felon, who was a drug addict for many years. I've been homeless and<br><br>
            have made countless other mistakes in my life. However, for every bad choice I've made,there has been some good. For example, I have learned in life not to <br><br>
            dwell on the poor choices a kid can make, but rather to focus on the positive things I took away from each and every life lesson I had the <br><br>
            pleasure of experiencing. 
            </p>
              <br><br><Br>
            <p>
              These decisions have taught me a lot. Whether it be the value of a dollar, to appreciate what I have, or the impact a single decision can have on <br><br>
              the rest of your life. If I never would have went to prison, I wouldn 't have met my wife in the beautiful state of Kentucky. If I didn't have to work in a factory, I probably<br><br>
              wouldn't have pushed myself to go back to college, and hone my mind. I have no regrets on my life. If I had the knowledge I have today back then, I <br><br>
              would do it all again to end up where I'm at now. 
            </p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
              I am a homeowner, a father, and soon to be college graduate. I could never have dreamed 15 years ago that I would be this accomplished <br><br>
              in my lifetime. The stars are the limit from here. Nothing can stop me but myself, and I have learned through all my hardships that most of the time, hardship <br><br>
              is self-inflicted. With a focused mind, and the same determination I once aimed at my drug use, I will be the best father, husband, and programmer this world has ever seen.
            </p>
            <br><br><br><br>
            <p>
              I landed on the programming field, because of my love for gaming. I don't intend on working on them, but it says something that during my spare time i <br><br>
            choose to sit in front of my computer for hours. I love it. The Feeling of the keys under my fingers, the problem solving when something isnt going right.<br><br>
            Ive been gaming since i was 8. The link to technology has been apparent from a young age. I feel like im pursing a dream going to school for this, and this oppurtnity wont be squandered.
