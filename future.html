  <h6>My Personal Futrue</h6>
  <div class="future">
    <p>
       The plan is always for my family to flourish. Everything I do is for the betterment of my family. The first step to bettering all futures for me is to apply to get my record expunged. <br><br>
       I have been sober for 7 years, 
       and have stayed out of trouble for all of it. I want to stay healthy and watch my kid(s) grow up. 
    </p>
  </div>
  <h6>My Professional Future</h6>
  <div class="future">
    <p>I know finding a job is going to be tough. I immediately have a leg down in this race. As a felon, I got turned away from working at gamestop. This was a major eye opening moment for me.<br><br>
      I can't let this falter my determination. I must press forward and do everything I can to stand out to be the best me I can, so I stand out amongst other candidates. I want to do something with my programming degree, and I wont settle for <br><br>anything less. </p>
  </div>
  <h6>My 5 year plan</h6>
  <div class="future">
    <p>In 5 years, my son will be starting school. I want to be able to allow my wife to stay home and homeschool our son. Which means I am going to need an income that can support this. I also plan to be building my house around this <br><br> time. I own 2 acres in Portland, TN, and I want to start that build before too long so my son doesn't have to transfer schools. I want to have a stable future for him. This also gets me closer to my side of the family, and I think that would <br><br> be good for him as well. </p>
