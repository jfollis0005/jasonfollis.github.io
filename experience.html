<h3>
  My Walks Of Life
</h3>

  <div class="experience">
  <p>
  I have walked many avenues of life, each of them teaching me their own little things. I have done everything from working at a pizza place for my first job, to being a utility worker,<br><br> 
  a stagehand and working at a factory. All of these jobs took a toll on my body. Once I realized this, I decided to go to school and hone my brain so I could work with that instead. Whether <br><br> 
  it be working as a team, providing great customer service, or learning the in's and out's of a factory's standard operating procedure and its systems. I have knowledge of many different <br><br>
  things. All of this combined  makes me a well rounded individual, and is a  testament to my ability to soak up information and apply it in many different situations.
